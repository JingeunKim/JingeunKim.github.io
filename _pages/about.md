Hi, I'm Jingeun Kim, Computer Science Ph.D. student at Gachon University, advised by Prof. Yourim Yoon.
I recieved B.S & M.S. in Computer Engineering at Gachon University.

Currently, I am planning to withdraw from Gachon University and am looking for a PhD position at other university.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate with me.
