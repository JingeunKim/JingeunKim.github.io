Hi, I'm Jingeun Kim, Computer Science Ph.D. student at Gachon University, advised by Prof. Yourim Yoon.
I recieved B.S & M.S. in Computer Engineering at Gachon University.

My research primarily focuses on developing efficient machine learning frameworks. Specifically, I aim to explore efficient models using neural architecture search based on genetic algorithms. Furthermore, I am currently working on model compression, particularly pruning, using genetic algorithms for CNN-based models and pre-trained language models.


Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate with me.
